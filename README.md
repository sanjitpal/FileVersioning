<h1>UIPath Project: File Versioning Automation</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This UiPath project automates the process of creating different versions of a file until it reaches a specified threshold limit. This is particularly useful for managing file versions efficiently, ensuring proper version control without manual intervention.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated Versioning:</strong> Automatically creates new versions of a file based on specified conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Threshold Limit:</strong> Sets a limit on the number of versions to be generated, preventing excessive file proliferation.</li>
<li><strong>File Management:</strong> Manages file versions seamlessly, allowing for easy tracking and retrieval of specific versions when needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Accepts the initial file and the threshold limit for versioning.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning Process:</strong> Utilizes UiPath activities to duplicate the file and rename it with an incremented version number.</li>
<li><strong>Check Threshold:</strong> Verifies if the threshold limit for versions has been reached.</li>
<li><strong>Loop:</strong> If the threshold is not met, repeats the versioning process until the limit is reached.</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Generates multiple versions of the file, each with an incremented version number appended to its name.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>UiPath Studio:</strong> This project is developed using UiPath Studio, so make sure you have the appropriate version installed.</li>
<li><strong>.NET Framework:</strong> Ensure your system has the required .NET Framework version compatible with UiPath Studio.</li>
</ul>
